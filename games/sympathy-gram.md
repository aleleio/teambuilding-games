# Sympathy Gram

## Description
One person stands in the middle of the circle. This person says something he/she likes. Everyone who also likes this joins in the circle and hugs the person in the middle. The person then steps back into the circle, and the next person goes in the middle.

## Description
Alternatively, you can also leave out the hugging and let people approach the center gradually, depending how much they like/agree with what the person in the middle said. Can also be used to create a quick overview of opinions on a topic.
