# Volcano Game

## Description
Use the rope to mark off an area for the volcano. In the middle of the volcano, there is a valuable object that the committee wants to have. Without touching the lava, the committee has to figure out a way to grab the valuable object. Anyone who touches the lava is dead and out of the game.
