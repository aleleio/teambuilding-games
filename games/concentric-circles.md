prior_prep: "Can I have us divide into two equal-sized groups!
Group one, please form a circle, facing outward. Group two, each person find a partner from group one and look deep in their eyes! One partner per person! 

Now, you have a minute or so to have a short conversation (about...), and when I say 'Switch' the group in the middle will move clockwise to the next partner from the outside group. 

Understood? (time for questions)

Good! Let's go! ;)"

# Concentric Circles

## Description
Divide the group in two. Have one half make a circle facing outward. The others then form a circle around the first group facing inward, with everyone facing someone from the other circle. 

Each person can talk to their 'partner' for a minute or two before you yell, "SWITCH" 
and have one circle move to the next person on their left. If participants seem shy, give them a topic to talk about each rotation, such as movies, college, food, etc.
