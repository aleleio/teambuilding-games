# Human Corridor

## Description
The group forms two lines, standing face to face. They each put out one arm so that their hands are almost at the same level, creating a "wall of arms" that seems impossible to get through. One group member runs from a five metres distance into this corridor as fast as they can while the other group members lift up their arms at the very last moment to let this person pass.
