# Blind Square

## Description
Everyone puts on their blindfolds. A rope is put on the ground with each group member being led to a certain point of  the rope and being told to hold it. When everyone is in position, they are told to form a perfect square.

## Description
Should the group fail for a long time to do so, one group member can be allowed to let go of the rope and find out the positions of the others by walking along the rope.
