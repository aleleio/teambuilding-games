# Drunken Bottle

## Description
The group stands in a close circle (each persons shoulders should be touching), with their hands faced towards the middle of the circle.

One person stands in the middle, arms at their sides, or over the chest, making themselves as stiff as a bottle, and with their eyes closed. The let themselves fall into the circle and are not allowed to move their feet while the group passes them around the circle as gently as possible.
