# River Game

## Description
Divide the committee into two groups. There is an imaginary river between the two groups, about a meter wide to start with. The task is to transfer the ball (or an alternative object) from one side of the river to the other, without throwing it. Every time the group succeeds, you increase the gap. 

  The delegates can be creative to use whatever they are wearing to transport the ball to the other side. Optionally you can provide them with some tools that they can use to transport the object.
