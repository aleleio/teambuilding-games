# Guide Me Home

## Description
Everyone puts blindfolds on except for one person. Before they start, they have to agree on signals with which the blindfolded people can be guided. Then, place the committee members in random locations across an outside area. The one person without a blindfold now has to guide them to a central point, without talking. He/she can only use the sounds that they have agreed on as signals.
